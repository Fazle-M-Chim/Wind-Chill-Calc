# Wind-Chill-Calculator
# Purpose
This repository contains a Python program for calculating wind chill temperature, along with an example input file and some sample output files. The program prompts the user to input the air temperature (in Fahrenheit, which should not exceed 50F) and the wind speed (in miles per hour, which should not be less than 3 mph), and then uses the formula for wind chill temperature to calculate and output the result. The program also allows the user to save the input data and the resulting wind chill temperatures to a file of their choice.
# Modules
The program uses the math and statistics modules in Python to perform the necessary calculations and compute the average wind chill temperature over multiple iterations. The program is fully documented and includes inline comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code.
# Usage
This program is useful for anyone who needs to calculate wind chill temperature for a given set of air temperature and wind speed values. It can be easily modified to accept input data from a file or other external source, and to output the results in various formats. The program is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, and can be run on any system that supports Python.
# Installation
To use the program, simply download the wind_chill.py file from this repository and run it using a Python interpreter. Follow the prompts to enter the air temperature and wind speed values, and then save the output data to a file of your choice. The program is customizable and can be modified to suit your specific needs and requirements.
